# It took me a lot of searching to find out how to do this.
# After fumbling around with giving ssh ControlPath command line arguments I came across this post that says it all very concisely: https://superuser.com/a/1362903

# Initiate the remote connection and control socket, but don't start a shell
ssh foo@bar.example.com -fNMS ~/.ssh/bar.socket

# Run some commands through the control socket
ssh foo@bar.example.com -S ~/.ssh/bar.socket "command 1"
ssh foo@bar.example.com -S ~/.ssh/bar.socket "command 2"

# Shut down the command socket
ssh foo@bar.example.com -S ~/.ssh/bar.socket -O exit
